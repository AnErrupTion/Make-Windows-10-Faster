CCleaner : I think everyone knows this program, it justs optimizes your PC performance by deleting junk files on your PC, and more...
CCleaner can also disable planned tasks, remove browsers extensions, uninstall apps, and more...

Open-Shell : Ok, this one is interesting, why did I add it to the list? Well, you see, Windows 10 Start Menu is very slow to open and some people can't even open it. Open-Shell is the solution, it's an updated fork of Classic Shell and brings a non-laggy and cool start menu.
Also, the 1.3 update of the Optimize Windows script disables completely the Windows 10 Start Menu, so be careful and install Open-Shell before running that script.
